**OUTLINE OF LESSON:**


Through our lesson, we will touch on **4 MAIN TOPICS** in relation to SASS. Each of the topics will include popcorn hacks, interactive activities, and working code blocks that the students will be able to work with. Then, there will be overarching hacks for the lesson as a whole that the students will be asked to complete for homework.

<br>

<br>

1. Introduction to SASS and GitHub Pages:

<br>

**Lesson Content:**

*SASS Introduction:*

- Explanations of the benefits of using SASS over traditional CSS, emphasizing improved code organization and maintainability

- Going over basic SASS syntax and comparing/contrasting with traditional CSS syntax. 


*Setting up SASS for VSCode:*

- Briefly going over the process of installing Live SASS Compiler in VSCode

- Show the hierarchy of referencing SCSS files in HTML in order to implement a particular stylesheet into an HTML document (demonstrate on the basic student site template for easy application for students)


*Discussing SASS Role in Design:*

- Discussing the role of SASS in the design phase of any project, importance of creating a visual concept before going into any sort of functional code


**HACK: Explore SASS documentation to discover any additional features not covered in the lesson and implement one or more of these features in your GH Pages project. Write a couple sentences explaining the feature and demonstrate it.**

<br>

<br>

2. Basic: Customizing Styles with SASS:

<br>

**Lesson Content:**

*Partials and Modular Styling:*

- In-depth explanation of SASS partials and their role in organizing and modularizing styles

- Explaining the benefits of being able to use partials to organize and structure code --> breaking stylesheets into smaller chunks and importing stylesheets into one main.scss file

*SASS Variables:*

- Exploring variables, way to store information to use later in a stylesheet

- Talking about the SASS variable syntax, going over !global and variable scope in SASS in general

*Nesting Techniques:*

- Going over what nesting is - nesting CSS rules within one another to create a more organized stylesheet

- Compare and Contrast - in CSS, show that rules are defined one by one rather than being nested


<br>

<br>

3. Responsive Design with SASS:

<br>

**Lesson Content:**

*Mixins & Custom Breakpoint Mixins:*

- Explain the purpose of mixins, how it lets you create CSS code that can be reused throughout the website (ENCAPSULATION!!)

- Discuss the creation of custom mixins for defining breakpoints and talk about how it can help to design flexible layouts 

*Image and Media Handling:*

- Discussing techniques for handling responsive images and media in SASS

- How can we use strategies to change the display of images based on a particular device's resolution? (MEDIA QUERIES)

*Flexbox and Grid Integration:*

- Flexbox and Grid layout techniques

- How can these systems in SASS simplify complicated responsive layouts

**HACK: Implement a responsive navigation menu using SASS which includes media queries.**

<br>

<br>

4. Miscellaneous, Advanced SASS Mechanisms:

<br>

**Lesson Content:**

*SASS Scripting and Functions:*

- Introduce scripting, talk about @for loops and conditional statements in SASS

- Demonstrate some of the built-in functions and the mechanism for creating custom functions

*Extending and Inheritance:*

- How to use @extend for style inheritance

- Describing situations in which it would be useful to use @extend (similar element styling with minute differences)

- Emphasize: Only need ONE class!

*Error Handling and Debugging in SASS:*

- How to handle errors and debug in SASS (@error, @warn, @debug directives)

- Touch on a couple common errors and troubleshooting solutions for these errors
